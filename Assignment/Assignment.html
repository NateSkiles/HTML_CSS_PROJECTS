        <h1>Cats!</h1>
        <p>A riveting story of a man's jounry from indiffernce towards cats, to taking 3-4 pictures a week of his girl-friends cats.</p>

        <h3>Dogs!</h3>
        <p>I'm pretty fond of dogs, probably moreso than cats. Easier to get an apartment with cats though! <a href="dog.html">Here</a> is a link to a cute pup</p>

            <p>I was reading a <a href = "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/26/dog-breeder-who-created-labradoodle-regrets-frankenstein-monster/3772586002/">USA today</a> article about the ramifcations of breeding designer dogs like the Labrodoodle above. The article went on to say:</p>
            <blockquote cite = "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/09/26/dog-breeder-who-created-labradoodle-regrets-frankenstein-monster/3772586002/">"I opened a Pandora's box and released a Frankenstein monster," he said of the hype.

                Labradoodles are just one of the many "designer dog" breeds commonly available today.
                
                While Labradoodles are not recognized as an official breed by the American Kennel Club, Brandi Hunter, the group's vice president of public relations and communications, says they and other "designer breeds" can be "loveable companions." </blockquote>
